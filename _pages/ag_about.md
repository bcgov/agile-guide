#About this Guide

This guide has been developed to help you align with agile principles and prepare your environment and team for running scrum. First and foremost, this guide is designed to help a B.C. government product (or service or program) owner determine if they are ready to embark on the transformation necessary to embrace the principles and values associated with agile software development. The scope of this guide is limited to the development of software products or solutions and examines the steps, processes and mindset necessary to create and run a single 5-9 person product team.

We would like to acknowledge the work of several governments, agencies and other collaborators, such as the [US Digital Service](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), who have created some comprehensive guides that are helping the development community improve the value and quality of software delivery in the public sector.

> **When reading this guide, please bear in mind that this is an alpha version. We'll be editing and adding to it to reflect our continually evolving agile product and service (aka “solution”) design strategy.  We hope that this guidance will be helpful to service stakeholders working across government and we welcome feedback.**
