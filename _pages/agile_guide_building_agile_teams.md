#Creating a Scrum Team

A scrum is defined as "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal",[3] challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach"[3] to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.

A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements volatility[4]), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

As part of their general computing controls for the creation of IT the private sector has embraced the the user centric concept of agile development as this methodology has proven to be a very effective way of managing risk in IT based projects. Agile is a practise that focuses on the delivery of business value and quality to the end user in an incremental and time efficient manner. As such the development and delivery of software has evolved over the past twelve years to include processes that permit a constant stream of new features to be delivered daily while maintaining functionality, stability and usability standards. In addition new ways of approaching the creation of enterprise solutions have emerged where design drives architecture and functional code is written based on preconceived tests (test driven development). To effectively participant in agile (or Mode 2) projects government programs need to ensure that they have a staff capability that includes working at the application code level. The primary purpose for this is to ensure that the function of qualified receivers (as prescribed in Chapter 6 of the Core Policy Manual) is fulfilled. The government staff must be able apply design, architectural and coding standards to the work that is submitted from both the broader public sector and private sector community partners in an open source procurement model or otherwise. Government staff will also be required to co-create code with this broader development community as well as work with user experience teams to develop proof of concepts and working prototypes. The government staff is also required to support the ongoing technology innovation of modern agile tool sets. To be compliant with this exception (and standard) your product development team must conform to the Agile Maturity Matrix Level 0.
Align with Agile
Setting up a SCRUM team is half the equation as to operate in an agile fashion requires an understanding of the underpinning principles and values that brings the community together. Essentially the 12 agile principles allude to values such as adaptation, cooperation and adjustment. To achieve this individuals within SCRUM teams must be open to the concept of transparency on a number of levels as described in the Government’s Open By Default initiative. In addition to this product team must be accepting of the fact that their project artifacts (including code) and methodologies will be open to inspection by people within and outside of their organization. These are critical behaviours that will improve the understanding of business needs as well as the overall quality of the products produced. Preparing and working to instil these values into the daily functions of the product team is critical. Training resources and links can be found in the agile wiki.
Create Your Government Scrum Environment
Not only should the scrum teams be prepared for the inevitable cultural shift but the organization as a whole needs to understand the product team’s behaviour so that they can interact and communicate effectively. For example, as the scrum team responds to demands from the Ministry service or program they may well need to rapidly scale on a temporary basis by interacting with Government’s vendor partners. They will need to do this quickly and often without being able to reference defined requirements. Therefore, product teams need to collaborate closely with their colleagues in finance to ensure an appropriate level of service and comfort. Tips and tricks can be found in the agile wiki. Identifying all the key stakeholders and involving them in the transformation to agile is the responsibility of the product team. 
Must to-do’s
Your ADM must be supportive.
There must be an executive sponsor at the Executive Director level.
You must develop a vision for your agile transformation i.e. what is the value proposition for your organization? (Refer to the Business Model Canvas for ideas).
You must have a dedicated self-organizing team.
Need to-do’s
Ensure that the SCRUM team have access to a system like GitHub, ZenHub, JIRA or Trello so that traceability and transparency can occur.
Engage your finance team to gain support for flexible team scaling on a time and materials basis.
Work with your organization's management teams and share your vision and goals.
You need to choose a methodology i.e. SCRUM, Kanban.
You need to determine one metric that you’re going to track i.e. velocity
Foster an environment that accepts user centric or human centered design (the Luma institute or Ideo.org  provide examples of this).
Create a Government SCRUM Process
The SCRUM process is owned by a single champion (often the Product Owner or SCRUM Master). This individual will foster an atmosphere of inclusivity within the organization to create an enduring and repeatable SCRUM process that is used to convert value propositions to user stories and channel these through a prioritization process to the SCRUM team.
Must To-Do’s
Create a basic SCRUM process by involving the organization’s management team.
Ensure that the executive sponsor includes this process into their standard battery of management meetings.
Ensure that the ADM is aware of this process (use a visual aid to communicate the value of the process).
Ensure that both senior leadership and management are kept aware of team performance as sprints are completed.
Need To-Do’s
Identify one senior executive as the sponsor for the process.
Involve stakeholder managers in an affinity cluster exercise.
Involve the product leadership and managers in a bulls-eye prioritization exercise.
Look for experienced help to design your sprint planning sessions.
Estimate team capacity (availability during sprint).
Start measuring team velocity (or your preferred metric).
Link performance metric to organizational success criteria or outcomes.
Be dogmatic about running sprint reviews and retrospectives.

There are lots of resources on the internet which describe how to run SCRUM. The Scrum Alliance has a good comprehensive article that explains all the fundamentals.
Create a Dedicated Government SCRUM Team
Creating a Government SCRUM team is not easy and you should not embark on the journey unless you have prepared the organizational environment to accept your agile experiment. To effectively run and support a SCRUM team your need “one part confidence, two parts humility and three parts sense of humour” (Fuda, 2009). SCRUM is based on the concept that there are three fixed quantities, people, time and quality. Therefore the product manager needs to ensure that the core SCRUM team has dedicated people that can work on the backlog without distractions. Another quality of a SCRUM team is synergy i.e. the interaction or cooperation of two or more agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. Continued collaboration within team members is essential to create this effect so it’s in the best interests of the organization to keep a SCRUM team together once formed. Often this will mean that line managers need to effectively “give-up” their staff to the SCRUM process; a difficult mindshift to establish.
Create Your Scrum Team
Preparing Your Government SCRUM Team
In order to prepare each individual within your SCRUM team we recommend that they attend the following courses:
An agile fundamentals workshop which incorporates:
Agile history
Agile mindset
The applicability of agile outside strict “software development”
One of the following:
Scrum master training
Scrum developer training
Product owner training
It is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to ensure that the above coursework and training is made available to each team member 
To Be Considered As Operating in a SCRUM Mode 2 You Need
To achieve the agile maturity base level (level 0) there are a minimum number of roles dedicated to the product SCRUM team:
Dedicated executive sponsor.
Dedicated Product Owner as described in the US Digital Services Playbook.
A Developer who is capable of working with our private sector partners at the code level.
A user experience resource who understands user-centered research and design

To achieve Level 1 the SCRUM team must include:
All roles for level 0 and,
A technical resource who has experience using automated testing frameworks.
A user experience researcher.

To achieve Level 2  the SCRUM team must include:
All roles for level 0-1 and,
A technical resource who has experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment.
A user experience application interaction designer.
