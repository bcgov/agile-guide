#Create Your Team

##Develop Your Scrum Processes
The scrum process is owned by a single champion. This individual will foster an atmosphere of inclusivity within the organization to create an enduring and repeatable scrum process that is used to convert value propositions to user stories and channel these through a prioritization process to the scrum team.

###Must Do:
1. Create a basic scrum process by involving the organization’s management team.
2. Ensure that the executive sponsor includes this process into their standard battery of management meetings.
3. Ensure that the ADM is aware of this process (use a visual aid to communicate the value of the process).
4. Ensure that both senior leadership and management are kept aware of team performance as sprints are completed.

###Should Do:
1. Identify one senior executive as the sponsor for the process.
2. Involve stakeholder managers in an affinity cluster exercise.
3. Involve the product leadership and managers in a bulls-eye prioritization exercise.
4. Look for experienced help to design your sprint planning sessions.
5. Estimate team capacity (availability during sprint).
6. Start measuring team velocity (or your preferred metric).
7. Link performance metric to organizational success criteria or outcomes.
8. Be dogmatic about running sprint reviews and retrospectives.

There are many resources that describe how to run scrum. The [Scrum Alliance](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2009/december/scrum-in-a-nutshell) has a good comprehensive article that explains all the fundamentals.

##Create Your Product Vision Statement
Creating a product vision statement is essential for galvanizing your team into action. The vision can also be used as an important change-leveraging tool with all of your stakeholders. There are many ways of creating this vision. See the [Luma Institute](https://www.luma-institute.com/) or [Ideo.org](https://www.ideo.org/)  provide examples of this.

##Create Your Initial Product Feature and Release Roadmap
Creating a product feature roadmap is a strategic tool that is a much more detailed companion to the broader product vision statement. The road map helps you communicate the direction, pace, and future state of the product. Essentially, it helps keep your team and stakeholders stay aligned.  

##Create Your Dedicated Team
Creating a scrum team is not easy and you should not embark on the journey unless you have prepared the organizational environment to accept your agile experiment. To effectively run and support a scrum team you need “one part confidence, two parts humility and three parts sense of humour” (Fuda, 2009). 

Scrum is based on the concept that there are three fixed quantities, people, time and quality. Therefore, the product manager needs to ensure that the core scrum team has dedicated people that can work on the backlog without distractions. Another quality of a scrum team is synergy, that is, the interaction or cooperation of two or more agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. Continued collaboration within team members is essential to create this effect so it’s in the best interests of the organization to keep a scrum team together once formed. Often this will mean that line managers need to effectively “give-up” their staff to the scrum process; a difficult mindshift to establish.

##Create a Training and Coaching Plan for Your Team
In order to prepare each individual within your scrum team we recommend that they attend the following:

	An agile fundamentals workshop which incorporates:
	* Agile history
	* Agile mindset
	* The applicability of agile outside strict “software development”
	
	One of the following:
	
	* Scrum master training
	* Scrum developer training
	* Product owner training

It is the responsibility of the scrum master to ensure that the above coursework and training is made available to each team member 

##Make Sure You’re Scrum Team is at Agile Maturity Matrix Level 0

It is important that you create a team that satisfies the conditions of the Agile Maturity Matrix (AMM) Level 0 [LINK NEEDED] as it is at this maturity level that your team will qualify for the OCIO Agile (Mode 2) Exception. The exception enables you to run your product team in an agile fashion and co-develop software with the private sector.

To achieve the agile maturity base level (level 0) there are a minimum number of roles dedicated to the product scrum team:
1. Dedicated executive sponsor.
2. Dedicated Product Owner as described in the [US Digital Services ](https://playbook.cio.gov/)Playbook.
3. A Developer who is capable of working with our private sector partners at the code level.
4. A User Experience resource who understands user-centered research and design.

###Exception To Chapter 12: Standard For Running An Agile Team

To effectively participant in agile projects, government product teams need to ensure that they have staff capable of working at the application code level. The primary purpose for this capability is to ensure that the function of a team qualified receiver (as prescribed in [Chapter 6 of the Core Policy Manual](http://www.fin.gov.bc.ca/ocg/fmb/manuals/CPM/06_Procurement.htm)) is fulfilled. 

The government staff must be able apply design, architectural and coding standards to the work that is submitted from both the broader public sector and private sector community partners in an open source procurement model or otherwise. Government staff will also be required to co-create code with this broader development community as well as work with user experience teams to develop proof of concepts and working prototypes. The government staff is also required to support the ongoing technology innovation of modern agile tool sets. To be compliant with this exception (and standard) your product development team must conform to the Agile Maturity Matrix Level 0.

##Make Sure You Can Scale Your Team Using Private Sector Partners

There are four basic phases to product development:

* prototyping
* growth
* maturity
* sunset

During each of these phases the team composition and size will differ, however, but as a product owner you will rely on a core team to provide continuity throughout the product lifecycle. The core team composition needs to be aligned with the Agile Maturity Matrix [ADD LINK] and you must scale using your private sector partners. A quick rule of thumb is that 60% of your team can be core, the remainder should be provided by partners. Work with your finance team to design a process where you can scale within 1-2 weeks. You can also liaise with the people at the BC Developer's Exchange [ADD LINK].
