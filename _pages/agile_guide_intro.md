The BC Government Agile Scrum Guide

#Introduction
Agile software development (also referred to as Mode 2) focuses on active user involvement, incremental releases, testing early and often, and delivering functional pieces of the application as soon as they're ready. The goal of agile development is to build upon small client-approved parts as the project progresses, as opposed to delivering one large application at the end of the project. The result of using agile, versus other more traditional approaches, is that you get the right application, not the one you thought you wanted 18 months ago.

We did not invent this approach. Industries and governments around the globe have adopted agile principles with great success. Preparing to use agile scrum in a government environment requires dedication, time and flexibility. 

The B.C. tech sector has embraced the value-driven approach of agile development as this framework has proven to be an effective way of managing risk in information technology (IT) based projects. Agile is a mindset that focuses on the delivery of business value and quality to the client in an incremental and iterative manner that provides the most value in the given time. As such, the development and delivery of software has evolved over the past decade to include processes that permit a constant stream of new features to be delivered daily while maintaining functionality, stability and usability standards. In addition, new ways of approaching the creation of enterprise solutions have emerged where design drives architecture and functional code is written based on preconceived tests (test-driven development).
